        <h3>Harvey Pale</h3>
        <p>
          Harvey Pale was born in Pheonix, Arizona. He refused to go out in the sun as a child, so his friends started calling him Harvey Pale. His brain got fried one time when he was water-skiing becasue he forgot to put a hat on his bald head. He can't remember his real name and lives with his momma.

        <h3>Jennifer Lawrence</h3>
        <p>
          After losing the love of her life in the 995th Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence came to Austin, Texas looking for a tall glass of...milk. She walked into Emo's, crying and looking like a hot mess, where she ran into Harvey Dale and Harvey Pale. The rest is history.
